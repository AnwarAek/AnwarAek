- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AnwarAek
I'm an Asp.net core backend developer junior, 
I'm interested by open source projects because it's very useful to acquire new skills and experience in our work,
I hope learnig something from this projects and other projects, I also woulde be very happy if I will find developers who will help me reach this goal and help them,
I would like to make a collaboration (so if you whant I'm here...),
I wish the best to everyone...
